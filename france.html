<center><h6><font face="Papyrus">What an incredible piece of architecture. In order to appreciate its wonder, I think it is crucial that we dive into its origins first, and how it came to be! The wrought-iron lattice tower was named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, who built it for the 1889 World's Fair. The construction of the 1,063 foot tall structure began on July 1, 1887 and was completed over 2 years later. The vast constructions in iron and steel were the great industrial advancements of that time, and the Eiffel Tower is still an irreplaceable symbol of Paris, France, drawing people from Europe and all over the world to the city.</h6></center>
